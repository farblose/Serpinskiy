## Sierpinski
The most effecient Sierpinski triangle chaos game method generator written in C++.

Chaos game method for Sierpinski triangle generation is described not formally by the following algorithm:
1. Select three distinct points in a plane and construct an initial triangle with these as the vertices.
2. Select randomly an initial point inside the triangle area and designate it as a main position.
3. Select randomly one of the three triangle vertices.
4. Select as a new main position a middle point in between the main position and the chosen vertex.
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 iteratively.
